# kmeans-algorithm
This is an unsupervised learning(clustering method) to train data which donot have label
# How this algorithm works----
As it is an unsupervised learning so we donot have labels. We have to find the centroid for each class
If we have labels then we can easily calculate the average and locate the centroid similarly if we have 
centroids then definitely we can put instances based on this.But we donot have both.
So the simple approach is to place centroid randomly anywhere in the plane and keep on updating its position
till it stop moving,that is our goal.
This is how this unsupervised algorithm works.
